# spanish information for 'immigrants' (i believe this does not have appropriate context for the current UA crisis, but may be good to link to)

# language learning resources:

This is the official european pictogram resource for learning languages. I think it would be good for
us to host both the en<->uk and es<->uk versions

Further, I have spoken with jara, who offers one-on-one spanish lessons. I will 
follow up with her after her holdays to identify

1 - whether she will offer a free/discount program for refugees
2 - whether she has a larger network available of teachers

I would also like to link to this, and it would be amazing to find out whether UA
refugees are being given priority/discounts/free education at these schools. At the very least
maybe we can find the specific list of schools and what languages they teach on the
canary islands:

#Travel and transportation

It appears Renfe (only applicable on mainland) is offering free train tickets to... well, anywhere for UA nationals:

Anectodally (i want to approach things anecdotally for many things), Olga was able
to get a local canarias bus card for her and her son with *only* her UA passport. Need
a link and/or story... i see nothing on TITSA site. need to know if she had to pay or if it was free


#Long-term stay

- what have the spanish offered in terms of temporary residency?
- what are the conditions (i suspect the answer is we don't fucking know) for extending such?
- is it currently possible for an UA national with either full time employment or autonomo status
  to claim a 'green card/tarjeta residencia' based on that status? if so, what
  does that mean for their status if/when their current 1y 'temporary' status expires
  or is not extended?
